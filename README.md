# Data Visualization

### 1. This Python project utilizes the 'pandas,' 'matplotlib,' and 'seaborn' libraries to analyze and visualize a dataset related to income and demographic factors. 
### 2. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, preprocessed to handle missing values, and then transformed to create insightful visualizations. 
### 3. Heatmaps illustrate gender and marital status, as well as education level and occupation, with respect to income. Catplots depict the distribution of gender across different work classes. Pie charts showcase the race distribution within different income categories. 
### 4. Scatter plots explore the relationship between age and capital gain for different income brackets, and a bar chart visualizes income distribution by gender. 
### 5. The project employs a combination of statistical and graphical techniques to gain insights into the dataset's patterns and trends.

### Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook.
